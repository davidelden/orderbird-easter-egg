# orderbird-easter-egg
Code challenge for orderbird that places an Easter egg in the DOM on any page.

### How to use
Test the project by using a local http server such as [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server).

Easter egg is revealed by clicking on the buttons with the `class "eggy"` or with the data attribute `data-eggy`.

Buttons with the `class disabled` or the `attribute disabled` will not reveal the Easter egg.

Entering in the Komani Code pattern `↑↑↓↓←→←→BA` will also reveal the Easter egg.
